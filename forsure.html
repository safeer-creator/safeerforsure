    <q><b><em><strong> THE LAST SERMON OF HOLY PROPHET</strong></em></b></q>
    <hr />
    <p>
        The Last Sermon of <b>the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)</b> holds a unique and timeless place in the
        history of Islam and in the moral heritage of humankind. Delivered on the 9th of Dhul-Hijjah, 10 A.H. (632
        A.D.), at Mount Arafat during his final pilgrimage (Hajjat-ul-Wida), it was not only his farewell address to the
        Muslims but also a universal charter of human rights, justice, and equality. This sermon summarizes the entire
        spirit of Islam and remains a guiding light for all generations.</p>
    <h3><strong><i>Historical Background:</i></strong></h3>
    <p>
        After successfully spreading the message of Islam throughout the Arabian Peninsula, the Holy Prophet (PBUH)
        performed his first and last pilgrimage to the Holy Ka‘bah. More than one hundred thousand companions
        accompanied him. On the 9th of Dhul-Hijjah, he stood on the plain of Arafat and delivered his sermon from the
        back of his camel, Qaswa. His words were simple yet profoundly meaningful, touching the hearts of all who heard
        them.

    <h3><strong><i>Main Themes of the Sermon:</i></strong></h3>
    <p>The sermon covered every major aspect of human life — spiritual, moral, social, political, and economic. The
        Prophet (PBUH) began by praising Almighty Allah and reminded the people of their duties towards Him and towards
        one another. He emphasized the sanctity of life, property, and honor, declaring that these were as sacred as the
        holy month and the holy city of Makkah.</p>
    <p>He abolished all forms of injustice and exploitation, particularly the cruel custom of charging interest (usury),
        which had oppressed the poor. The Prophet (PBUH) declared that all blood feuds of the pre-Islamic period were
        canceled, establishing peace and forgiveness as the foundation of society.</p>
    <h3><strong><i>Equality and Brotherhood:</i></strong></h3>
    <p>One of the most revolutionary aspects of the Last Sermon was the declaration of universal human equality. The
        Prophet (PBUH) proclaimed:</p>
    <blockquote>“All mankind is from Adam and Eve. An Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab, nor does a non-Arab have
        any superiority over an Arab; a white has no superiority over a black, nor does a black have any superiority
        over a white — except by piety and good action.”</blockquote>
    <p>This statement demolished all racial, ethnic, and social distinctions, establishing the principle of universal
        brotherhood and moral merit as the only measure of superiority.</p>
